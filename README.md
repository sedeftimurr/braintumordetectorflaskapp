# Brain Tumor Classification Flask App

This project is a Flask web application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that classifies brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance) images as "tumor present" and "tumor absent". The application allows users to upload MRI images and quickly find out whether there is a tumor in these images.
